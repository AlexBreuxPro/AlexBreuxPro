Hi 👋

Data-driven individual, curious and always eager to improve & learn in this fast-paced IT world 🌎.

My main focus is currently IT asset management.
This is a broad practice, with many use cases, from Finance, Security and Compliance. 
📢"You can't secure what you can't see/understand"

☁️With companies workloads being heavily hosted at CSPs datacenters, either Cloud-native or Hybrid fashion, the following areas have strong synergy with the ITAM practice:
-Cloud FinOps "Make the most out of every dollar spent on the Cloud"
-Cloud Security "It is not a matter of if, but a matter of when"
